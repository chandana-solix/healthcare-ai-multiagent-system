## Server-Specific Fixes

### Fix 1: WebSocket Configuration for Production

Add to your server configuration (nginx/apache):

```nginx
# For Nginx
location /ws {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_read_timeout 86400;
}
```

### Fix 2: Update WebSocket Connection for HTTPS

Create a new file for client-side WebSocket handling:
