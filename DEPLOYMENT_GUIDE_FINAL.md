# Healthcare AI System - Complete Deployment Guide

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Cost Discrepancy - RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Dashboard showed $18,700, Patient View showed $12,000
- **Solution**: Created unified `healthcare_analytics.py` agent
- **Status**: Both views now show consistent $18,700

## üîß Remaining Issues to Fix

### 2. ‚ùå Agent Communication Not Displaying on Server

**Root Causes:**
1. WebSocket connection blocked by proxy/firewall
2. HTTPS requires WSS (secure WebSocket)
3. Missing WebSocket configuration in server

**Solutions:**

#### A. Update Nginx/Apache Configuration
```nginx
# Add to your nginx.conf
location /ws {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_read_timeout 86400;
}
```

#### B. Update Dashboard JavaScript
Replace WebSocket initialization in dashboard.html with the code from:
`server_fixes/agent_communication_fix.js`

#### C. Add Fallback Display
The fix includes fallback to display stored messages when WebSocket fails.

## üìã Complete System Verification Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Tests

1. **Run Comprehensive Test Suite**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nandichandana/Downloads/healthcare-ai-multiagent-system
   python server_fixes/comprehensive_test.py
   ```

2. **Manual Testing Checklist**

   #### Dashboard View
   - [ ] Patient information displays correctly
   - [ ] Risk stratification shows proper color coding
   - [ ] Lab analysis shows patterns
   - [ ] Imaging analysis displays findings
   - [ ] Clinical decision shows treatment plan
   - [ ] Healthcare Analytics shows 6 days, $18,700
   - [ ] Consensus recommendations display
   - [ ] Agent communication panel (fix if needed)

   #### Patient View
   - [ ] Alert section shows appropriate urgency
   - [ ] Hospital admission shows 6 days
   - [ ] Cost estimate shows $18,700
   - [ ] Treatment options display correctly
   - [ ] Red flags/safety warnings show
   - [ ] Medical team discussion tab works
   - [ ] Report generation works

### Server Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export ENVIRONMENT=production
   export SERVER_HOST=your-server.com
   export FRONTEND_URL=https://your-server.com
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 755 uploads
   chmod 755 static
   ```

4. **Run Deployment Checks**
   ```bash
   python server_fixes/deployment_utils.py
   ```

5. **Start with Production Settings**
   ```bash
   # Using Gunicorn
   gunicorn intelligent_orchestrator:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

   # Or using PM2
   pm2 start intelligent_orchestrator.py --interpreter python3 --name healthcare-ai
   ```

## üö® Critical Server Configuration

### 1. WebSocket Support
- Ensure reverse proxy supports WebSocket upgrade
- Configure timeout to prevent disconnections
- Enable CORS for your domain

### 2. File Upload Limits
```nginx
# Nginx
client_max_body_size 50M;
```

### 3. SSL/HTTPS Setup
- WebSocket must use WSS on HTTPS
- Update all hardcoded URLs to use relative paths

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. WebSocket connection success rate
2. Analysis completion time (should be <15 seconds)
3. Agent communication message count
4. Error rates by endpoint

### Logging
Add these to your production config:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('healthcare_ai.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Agent Communication Not Working
1. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
2. Verify `/ws` endpoint is accessible
3. Check if messages are in `conversation_highlights`
4. Use fallback display mode

### Cost Calculations Wrong
1. Verify `healthcare_analytics.py` is imported
2. Check risk level is passed correctly
3. Verify diagnosis is recognized

### Analysis Takes Too Long
1. Check if GPU is available for models
2. Verify Ollama is running (if using AI features)
3. Check file sizes aren't too large

## üì± Final Testing Protocol

1. **Test with Different Patients**
   - Low risk patient (verify lower costs)
   - High risk patient (verify $18,700 for 6 days)
   - Critical patient (verify ICU costs)

2. **Test Error Handling**
   - Upload invalid files
   - Disconnect during analysis
   - Test with Ollama offline

3. **Performance Test**
   - Multiple simultaneous analyses
   - Large image files
   - Poor network conditions

## ‚úÖ Ready for Production Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass in comprehensive_test.py
- [ ] Cost calculations are consistent
- [ ] Agent communication works (or fallback displays)
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Logging is configured
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS is setup
- [ ] WebSocket proxy is configured
- [ ] File permissions are correct
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Monitoring is in place

## üöÄ Launch!
